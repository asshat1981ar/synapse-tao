    name: Implement Self-Analysis Module in TAO Observe Stage
    description: >
      Add runtime metric evaluation and lesson capture to the Observe stage
      of the TAO loop.
    steps:
      - Add a `SelfAnalysisEngine` class to compute and compare metrics (coverage delta, errors, latency)
      - Modify `observeStage()` in `taoLoopService.ts` to use this engine
      - Log outputs and update orchestrator knowledge graph
      - Add unit tests for analysis logic
    success:
      - `pnpm test` passes
      - Logs show analysis + KG update
      - Diagram updated in `diagram.mmd`

  - id: SC-008
    name: Integrate Self-Correcting Feedback in TAO Act Stage
    description: >
      Add automatic retry, error-patching, and correction logic during plan execution
      to ensure the Act stage can recover and improve autonomously.
    steps:
      - Create `SelfCorrector` module
      - Enhance `actStage()` to:
          - Retry known error patterns
          - Patch or fallback as needed
          - Log corrections
      - Write tests to simulate execution failures and auto-corrections
    success:
      - All tests pass
      - Retry logic proven
      - Logs confirm fallback mechanisms

  - id: SC-009
    name: Add Self-Learning to Think Stage
    description: >
      Implement learning from past sprints by integrating knowledge graph data into the
      Think stage. Plans should reflect learned lessons and historical outcomes.
    steps:
      - Build `SelfLearner` utility
      - Update `thinkStage()` to query past sprint knowledge
      - Modify plan structure to include learned parameters
      - Add synthetic test plan validations
    success:
      - Plans reflect lessons from KG
      - Learning path logged
      - Tests simulate learning-driven planning

  - id: META
    name: TAO Meta-Loop Optimization Enhancement
    description: >
      Improve `optimizeLoop()` logic with dynamic threshold tuning and advanced metrics.
      Enable predictive adjustments based on trends in observed data.
    steps:
      - Refactor `optimizeLoop()` to:
          - Tune coverage/error thresholds in real time
          - Detect anomalies in metrics
          - Recommend systemic adjustments
      - Document new optimization process
      - Add frontend-ready metrics schema
    success:
      - Updated loop logic validated
      - Metrics reflect optimization
      - Frontend integration spec documented
